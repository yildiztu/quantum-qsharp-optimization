# Quantum Q# Optimization
An example optimization problem with a quadratic objective function and both linear and quadratic constraints

## File: qsharp-optimization-01.qs
This code defines an optimization problem with a quadratic objective function f(x) represented by a quadratic form 0.5 * x^T A x + b^T x, linear constraints g(x) represented by Cx - d and quadratic constraints h(x) represented by x[i]^2. It then uses the Q# Optimizer to solve the optimization problem and store the result in the input variable x. Note that this code is an example and you need to provide appropriate input such as matrix A, b, C, d and qubits qs according to your problem.

The objective function f(x) represents the total cost of the logistics problem and is defined as x^T cost x where cost is a matrix representing the cost of sending goods from one location to another. The linear constraints g(x) represent the capacity constraints and are defined as Cx - d where C is a matrix representing the capacity of each location, and d is a vector representing the demand for goods at each location. The non-negativity constraint h(x) ensure that the values of x are non-negative.
It then uses the Q# Optimizer to solve the optimization problem and store the result in the input variable x.
Note that this code is an example and you need to provide appropriate input such as matrix cost, capacity and demand, and qubits qs according to your logistics problem. You may also need to make other modifications to the code based on the specific requirements of your problem.
